First we need a virtual environment. We can create one using the following command:

```bash 
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Then we need to activate the virtual environment:

```bash 
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Then we must install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, we can run and debug the application with vscode.
