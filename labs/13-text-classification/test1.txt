Investigating the potential for life around the stars

When the world’s most powerful telescope launches into space this year, scientists will learn whether Earth-sized planets in our 'solar neighborhood' have a key prerequisite for life — an atmosphere.

These planets orbit an M-dwarf, the smallest and most common type of star in the galaxy. Scientists do not currently know how common it is for Earth-like planets around this type of star to have characteristics that would make them habitable.

"As a starting place, it is important to know whether small, rocky planets orbiting M-dwarfs have atmospheres," said Sydney Mattos, a doctoral student in Bellows College’s Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. "If so, it opens up our search for life outside our solar system."
